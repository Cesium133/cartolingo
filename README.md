# CartoLingo: A visual representation of languages in the world and your community

## Demo: http://kevincheriyan.com/cartolingo/home.html
CartoLingo uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript to build a full stack web application that allows users to submit information about the presence of 
languages in their community. Users can submit info from the "Submit data" page and view the data from the top menu as well. The project
was a result of my final project for GEOG657:Web Programming at University of Maryland- College Park's Master's Program in GIS.

CartoLingo uses ESRI's Leaflet library for mapping, Postgres and PHP for backend database management and PHP mailer for users to contact site admin.
